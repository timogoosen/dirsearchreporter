dirsearchreporter

This tool takes what you have in your ~/dirsearch/reports directory 
and does handy stuff with it.

So far we have planned:
1. Create wordlists based on what you've found before
2. Detect when a site gives 200 for junk pages as opposed to HTTP 404 and then discard those results.
3. Just more intelligent directory searching.


Thanks to author of dirsearch for great tool that was coded with blood sweat and python3.
